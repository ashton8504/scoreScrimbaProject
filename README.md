Scoreboard Project:
This project is a simple scoreboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of JavaScript logic and the DOM (Document Object Model) to create an interactive scoreboard.

Technologies Used:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

Project Overview:
The scoreboard project is a web-based application that allows users to track and update scores for two teams. It consists of two score sections representing the home team and the guest team, each with buttons to increment the score by 1, 2, or 3 points. Additionally, a reset button is provided to reset the scores back to zero.

Project Features:
Two Score Sections: The scoreboard includes separate score sections for the home team and the guest team. Each section displays the current score for the respective team.

Score Increment: Users can click on the buttons labeled "+1", "+2", and "+3" to increment the score for the respective team by the corresponding number of points.

Reset Functionality: The reset button allows users to reset both scores back to zero, providing a clean starting point for a new game.

Interactive Design: The project incorporates basic styling using CSS to enhance the visual appearance of the scoreboard. The buttons change color when pressed to provide visual feedback to the user.

Project Structure:
index.html: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the scoreboard.
index.css: The CSS file that contains the styles for the scoreboard.
script.js: The JavaScript file that implements the logic for updating the scores and handling button clicks.

Conclusion:
The scoreboard project serves as a practical exercise for practicing JavaScript logic and manipulating the DOM to create an interactive user interface. By building this project, you gain a better understanding of how to update content dynamically based on user actions and create an engaging user experience.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to further enhance the scoreboard or adapt it to fit your specific requirements.

Happy scoring!
